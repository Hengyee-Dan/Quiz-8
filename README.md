# Part1 : Imaging Technique Inspiration

In the Sci-film "The Matrix"ï¼Œa classic opening scene shows Matrix Rain, which uses rotating letters and letters from top to bottom to simulate the rainfall. Considering there is a different colored cricle in the image , we can take inspiration from them to animate the cricles to similarly fall top to bottom. This approach serves two purposes : first , it is to simulate the natural growth patterns, and the other is to enhance the dynamic of the picture . Finally , makes the picture more dynamic.
